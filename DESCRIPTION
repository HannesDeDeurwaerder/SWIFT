Description: 	Multiple functions for tracking stable water isotopic fluctuations
              and variance along the lenght of a plant using the SWIFT model. 
              Function SWIFT_SB and SWIFT_H can respectively be used to 
              calculate the isotopic signature over time at the stem base of the
              plant, or at a by the user defined height and time. Additional 
              functions are SoilRootCond, PSI0calc and Bprep which in this 
              order help the user to define (i) the soil to root conductivity 
              for every defined soil layer, (ii) the water potential at stem 
              base for every timestep, and (iii) the root length distribution 
              for every defined soil layer.
