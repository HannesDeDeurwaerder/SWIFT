\title{Calculate the root length distribution with depth}
\description{ 
This function constructs a vector containing the root length distribution of a 
plant at every defined soil layer [in m m-3]}
\usage{ Bprep(beta = NULL, R0 = NULL, Z = NULL)}
\arguments{
  \item{beta}{
  Description: Factor in the root length density distribution function; 
	Structure: One value, derived from Jackson et al. (1996), table 1}
  \item{R0}{
  Description: Factor in the root lenght density distribution function; 
	Structure: One value, representative of the studied plant, here derived 
	from Huang et al, 2017}
  \item{Z}{	
  Description: A vector of soil depths [in m]; 		
	Structure: A discrete vector  of n elements, where n corresponds to the number
	of soil layers}
}
\details{}
\value{
A discrete vector of n elements, with n the number of soil layers, containing 
the root lenght distribution of a studied plant}
